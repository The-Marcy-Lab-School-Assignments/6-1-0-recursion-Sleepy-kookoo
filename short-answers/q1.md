# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
  a recursive function continues to call itself with smaller versions of the original problem until it finds the base case and solves it directly.

  2 cases are: 
  Base case: It's like a stopping point where the function no longer needs to call itself.
  Recursive Case: This is when the function divides the problem into smaller sections and calls itself to solve them.
